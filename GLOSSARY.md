Drupal is a software that can be used by individuals or groups of users -- even those lacking technical skills -- to easily create and manage many types of Web sites. The application includes a content management platform and a development framework, which is extensible enough to be used for many projects including game development, financial accounting, and more.

# {{ book.glossary.drupal_8 }}
{{ book.glossary.drupal_8 }} is where the Drupal Community formally, and fully, adopted the *"Proudly Made Elsewhere"* mentality of the greater Software Development Community worldwide. Also known as "Modularity", {{ book.glossary.drupal_8 }}'s *"Proudly Made Elsewhere"* approach leverages a number of advanced features and external tools in order to present *all* developers with an advanced API beyond almost any CMS around today. Knowledgeable {{ book.glossary.drupal_7 }} developers will definitely notice many changes throughout the *language* and *tools* used to develop {{ book.glossary.drupal }} sites, but the overall structure and Administration remained mostly the same. See [d.o. | Getting Started - Background & Prerequisites (Drupal 8)](https://www.drupal.org/node/2182165 "d.o. | Getting Started - Background & Prerequisites (Drupal 8)") for more information.

# {{ book.glossary.git }}
Git is a {{ book.glossary.vcs }} used by the Drupal Community.Git keeps track of 'line-by-line' changes while treating *all* files (even SQL dumps) as text files. This allows for recursion and revisions to extend into the great beyond while taking up very little space on any given harddrive. Only the 'current' file exists at any current time, allowing snapshots, instead of differences, for those familiar with other VCS software. See [git | 1.3 Getting Started - Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics "git | 1.3 Getting Started - Git Basics") for more information.

# {{ book.glossary.saas }}
Software as a Service, also known as SaaS, is a software delivery method where the software is hosted (and often managed) by a third-party company. Some SaaS companies, such as SAP and SalesForce, own the software offered. In contrast, many hosting companies also follow the Open SaaS model. Like SaaS, companies offering OSaaS service host open source software on their systems. Pantheon.io is a good example of a company originally founded on the OSaaS model, though they have greatly expanded services since that time.

# {{ book.glossary.vcs }}
Also known as version control, source control, or revision control. Version Control Systems (VCS) add a text-based layer of maintaining *all*changes within an interative design process. Each time the document is 'saved' to the repository, the save is given a unique identifier that allows a Developer to fall back to (or before) that specific save. Newer systems, like {{ book.glossary.git }}.
