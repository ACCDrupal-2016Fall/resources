# Extensions Used

## Projects

> A **Project**, in relation to Drupal, is a directory containing a tool that can be used to create, extend, or power Drupal. The Core Drupal Distribution, for example, is a Project.

Examples of Projects include:
* **Core Releases:** Drupal 6.x, Drupal 7.x, Drupal 8.x, etc.
* **Distributions:**  Commerce Kickstart, Panopoly, Open Atrium, etc.
* **Themes:** Zen, Bootstrap, Omega, Adaptive Theme, etc.
* **Modules:** Views, Token, Pathauto, etc.
* **Translation projects:** Ukrainian, Hungarian, Spanish, etc.

Distribution projects and Translation Projects are out of scope for this course, but Students are, as always, encouraged to explore the possibilities on their own. The *Web 3.0* world encourages companies and tools to be responsive on a global scale and reaching customers in many different languages can only help a business succeed.

### Core Release used in this course

This course was written for Drupal 7.43, the final Drupal 7 release.

### Themes
* [Zen theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/zen "Zen theme") - Zen is arguably one of the most powerful standards-compliant theme-builder for Web Authors just learning Drupal's powerful subtheming toolset. Zen has always maintained [fantastic online documentation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/theme/zen "fantastic online documentation"), so it makes a great reference even after aspiring Web Authors graduate into more powerful and flexible theme engines. Since early in both Wordpress and Drupal the Zen theme has remained on the cutting edge of technological *capability*, yet has always kept **extremely** well documented instructions on theming right within the project. In addition, the project maintains standards compliance across the web, so it is always a good choice for aspiring Developers.

### Modules
* [Nodeblock module](https://www.drupal.org/project/Nodeblock "Nodeblock module") - Exposes Nodes as Blocks
* [Blockify module](https://www.drupal.org/project/blockify "Blockify module") - Exposes a number of Drupal Core elements as blocks
* [Display Suite module](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds "Display Suite module") - Adds a 'Drag and Drop' interface to content display, allowing maximum control of content display.
* [Panels module](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels "Panels module") - Allows creation of customized layouts and is the building block of tools such as the Display Suite and Panelizer.
* [Panelizer module](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer "Panelizer module") - The Panelizer module allows you to attach Panels to any node in the system.
* [Views module](https://www.drupal.org/project/views "Views module") - Views allows for *custom* SQL queries to be created dynamically. In layperson's terms, Views is a really powerful module for building out your content to *your* specification. Such as, for example, only loading the photo and title of each piece of content for Articles being displayed on your News page.
* Imagecache
* CCK
* CTools
* Libraries
* ThemeKey

> **Note** Some of the required modules are dependent on other modules to install. These dependencies are clarified within each Section where the Module is used, but Students can also see the Project page for any Module to learn about required dependencies.

> **Note** Some Modules also require special *Libraries* to function. These *Libraries*, which typically require the very appropriately named *Libraries* Module, extend Drupal using Projects **external** to Drupal, such as Foundation, Bootstrap, Accessible MegaMenus, the highly accessible Slick Carousel, and more....
