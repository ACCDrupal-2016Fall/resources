## Charles Leverington

Howdy.

As a Texan, I am told (often) I pretty much have to start with Howdy. Also, no, we do not check our horses at the border.

My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran or cleverington).

I am a near-Fanatical Drupalist, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens, and (soon) Drupal 8. To date, I have been a Contributor or Developer for three published websites and one Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet.

I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net \(aka: [Pedran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/164598/Pedran "Pedran's FanFiction Pad") \).

Concerning Web Development and Drupal, I am currently writing a companion book entitled *"A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything"*, which will remain as a free ebook forever under the Creative Commons License. In addition, I have extensive experience teaching Drupal Administration, Web Authoring, local development methodologies, and, most recently, have given lectures on the importance of Design Systems, Accessibility, and Modularity in the modern web.
