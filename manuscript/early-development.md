# Early Development

Authoring a project in any modern CMS begins with the tools chosen to author it *with*.

Drupal is fully featured and capable of huge layers of **extensibility**. Extensibility, meaning 'able to be made bigger' (basically). This is a small piece of a concept that will be defined later in the book called **modularity**. Modularity can be thought of by imagining a computer with a single *virtual* motherboard. Because the foundation of the computer is virtual, it can be upgraded piece-by-piece, part-by-part until the new system has no relation to the old, yet is infinitely better.

## Modularity

Both the Open Source Community and Drupal thrive on the concept of Modularity (and the Design Systems fuelling it).

A good comparison to make would be setting aside the parts and tools needed to build a house.

Because the Open Source Community continually improves on everything within itself, no version of Drupal will ever come with all the tools a Web Author will need to succeed. It will always come with the tools needed to succeed, have no doubt of that, but not the **best** tools.

### Here are a few examples of tools that can make a new Web Author's life a little easier in Drupal:
#### That are mostly used only for Drupal
* **Virtual Machine (VM) Tools:**
    * [Kalabox](http://www.kalabox.io/ "Kalabox") - Push-click installation of local Backdrop, Drupal 7, Drupal 8, and/or Wordpress installations. A fairly slick tool for scaffolding, building, and creating web systems without the massive complexity involved with the typical Development Process that has existed until recent years.
    * [Jeff Geerling's](http://jeffgeerling.com/ "Jeff Geerling's Website") [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com "Drupal VM") - A not-quite Push-click Virtual Machine builder which supports Drupal 7.x and Drupal 8.x out of the box, but can be configured/extended to support almost **any** Stack-based local development environment such as Apache/nginx, PHP 5.5/5.6/7.0, and beyond.
    * [Dmytro Danylevskyi's](http://dmytro.danylevskyi.com/ "Dmytro Danylevskyi's Website") [Vagrant Drupal Development](http://www.drupalvm.com "Vagrant Drupal Development") platform,
    * [Acquia's](https://www.acquia.com/ "Acquia's Website") [Acquia Dev Desktop](https://www.acquia.com/downloads "Acquia Dev Desktop"),
    * [Blink Reaction's](https://github.com/blinkreaction "Blink Reaction's") [Drude](https://github.com/blinkreaction "Drude") - An offshoot of the boo2docker-vagrant-box that has been specifically configured for *Drupal*-based development gaining ground in the DevOps industry because it uses Docker's Container System.
* **Development Tools**
    * [Phase 2's](https://www.phase2technology.com "Phase 2's Website") [DevTools.io](http://phase2.github.io/devtools/ "DevTools.io"),
    * [Moshe Weitzman's](https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman "Moshe Weitzman's Website") [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush "Drush"),
    * [Four Kitchens'](http://fourkitchens.com/ "Four Kitchens") [Aquifer.io](http://aquifer.io/ "DevTools CLI"),
    * [Pantheon.io's](https://pantheon.io/ "Pantheon.io'") [Terminus CLI](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/ "Terminus CLI"),
    * [Drupal Console](https://drupalconsole.com/ "Drupal Console"),
* **Hosting Platforms**
    * [Pantheon.io](https://pantheon.io/ "Pantheon.io"),
    * [Acquia Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud "Acquia Cloud"),
* and many, **man** others...
