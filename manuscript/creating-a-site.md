# Creating Your First Site

There are many methods to creating a Drupal 7 site. Some are hard, most are easy.

> **Best Practices** - No matter which hosting company or method is chosen, installing Drupal from scratch is almost always unnecessary work. Let one of the software programs built to do so complete the process for you instead.

For **this** course, your first site will be created dynamically by Pantheon.io's site-creation engine. See below for further instruction on sites not hosted on Pantheon.io prior to installation.

## Goals

* Create a functional Drupal site for use as a portfolio
* Create Dev, Test, and Live environments on Host Servers (at Pantheon.io)

## Step-by-Step Site Creation
* **Creating Your First Site**
    * [Step 1 - Creating A Site](../manuscript/unit-1-preparing-your-development-environment/creating-a-site/creating-a-site_1.md "Step 1 - Creating A Site")
    * [Step 2 - Installing A Site](../manuscript/unit-1-preparing-your-development-environment/creating-a-site/creating-a-site_1.md "Step 2 - Installing A Site")
    * [Step 2 - Visit Your New Site](../manuscript/unit-1-preparing-your-development-environment/creating-a-site/creating-a-site_1.md "Step 3 - Visit Your New Site")

> **Note** - For the rest of this course, "*your*" site will be referred to as "*https://mysite.pantheon.io*".

> This means that if your site is "*johnsportfolio.pantheon.io*", then instructions for accessing the Administration Menu via *https://mysite.pantheon.io/admin* should instead be read as *johnsportfolio.pantheon.io/admin*.
