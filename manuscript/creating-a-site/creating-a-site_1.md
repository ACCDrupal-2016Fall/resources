# Creating A Site

## Step 1

### Navigate to Pantheon.io Dashboard
![Create New Site](../../images/creating-a-site/creating-a-site_2.JPG)

### Click **+ Create New Site**
![Create New Site](../../images/creating-a-site/creating-a-site_1.JPG)

### Enter a Name
This site name will be registered under multiple places, unless you've chosen a paid plan:

* dev-yoursite.pantheon.io
* test-yoursite.pantheon.io
* yoursite.pantheon.io

That's correct. If you are willing to keep your site under a Pantheon.io URL, you can actually use the Live site for showcase purposes.

> **Warning** - Once you pass this step, don't stop until your site is fully created or you will have to wait a few minutes, refresh, delete the newly *uncreated* site, and start again.
