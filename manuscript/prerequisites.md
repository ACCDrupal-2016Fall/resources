# Prerequisites

## Prerequisite Knowledge

All aspiring developers should have:
* a familiarity with computers and browsing the Internet;
* Intermediate WWW Authoring knowledge and experience; and,
* basic HTML and CSS styling & theming knowledge.

Knowledge of command line tools, such as iTerm2 (Mac OS) or the Command Prompt (Windows) is preferred, but in no way required.

The most vital prerequisite for the course is a willingness to learn new, exciting, and engaging technologies used throughout the world today.

Despite mostly being open source projects, the tools used within this class are applicable across many industries. Many considered the widespread adoption of Open Source software a scenario of "in spite of" being Open Source for a very long time. Unfortunately for those proprietary companies, software such as the Text-Editor [atom.io](https://atom.io/ "atom.io") and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/ "Drupal") itself are gaining notoriety and more universal adoption **because** they are open source. These projects have Communities numbering in the thousands (or hundreds of thousands) tweaking, improving, and perfecting the software.

As stated, the tools, methodologies (methods), design approach, and application structures learned within this class can be taken far, far beyond Drupal.

## Challenges

Every Challenge exercise will include careful walkthroughs with screenshots and Instructor-led development.

It is important to remember as the course progresses that early development in any platform, system, software language, or CMS often results in errors, which is **OKAY**.

A full Section is dedicated to Troubleshooting [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/ "Drupal") within the Course. Students are welcome to try Troubleshooting their own issues or contacting their Instructor.
