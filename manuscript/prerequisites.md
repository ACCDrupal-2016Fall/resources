# Prerequisites

Students taking this course should have a solid familiarity with computers, browsing the Internet, and (preferably) Intermediate WWW Authoring, HTML, and CSS.

The most vital prerequisite for the course is a willingness to learn new, exciting, and engaging technologies used throughout the world today.

Many considered the widespread adoption of Open Source software a scenario of "in spite of" being Open Source for a very long time.

Unfortunately, for those proprietary companies, software such as the Text-Editor [atom.io](https://atom.io/ "atom.io") are gaining notoriety and more universal adoption **because** they are open source.

The tools, methodologies (methods), design approach, and application structures learned within this class can be taken far, far beyond Drupal.
