# Drupal Core Basics

## Core Drupal Parts and Functionality

This section touches lightly on the parts, pieces, functionality, and (most importantly) **concepts** within Drupal which define the absolute basics of Drupal.

> **Best Practices** - Keep in mind, these definitions, like all parts of Drupal, are **modular**. They can be expanded upon, replaced, and even completely removed in certain situations.

### Nodes

### Users and permissions

### Blocks
The *Core* Drupal Blocks can (and should) be extended within Drupal 7 before using your new site.

This is because, in early Drupal 7 Developers would simply turn off the *undesired* pieces of Drupal using the theme layer. Instead of that added difficulty, instead Web Authors can install extensions like the [Nodeblock module](https://www.drupal.org/project/Nodeblock "Nodeblock module") (to expose Nodes as Blocks) and the [Blockify module](https://www.drupal.org/project/blockify "Blockify module") (which exposes a number of Drupal Core elements as blocks).

### Menus

### Other basic Drupal Core Tools
