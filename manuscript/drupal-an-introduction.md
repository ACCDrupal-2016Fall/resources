# Drupal - An Introduction

My other in-development book has the following quote and I will always stand by it:

> "One does not need to know any JavaScript to become a Drupal Site Builder and the HTML/CSS knowledge requirements are small at-best."

## Dries - In the Beginning

*More information can be found [here](https://www.drupal.org/node/297669 "here").*

Though *officially* 15 years of age, during the creation of this curriculum, the software which would later **become** Drupal was first created by Founder Dries Buytaert some time in 1998, almost "by accident". As a college student at the University of Ghent, Dries felt the need for a more solid (and reliable) Message Board not plagued by the spam-content of sites like MySpace.com or LiveJournal.com.

This "Message Board" gained Dries a lot of interest and feature requests over the next few years, until he decided to create the Open Source Software "Drupal" was born based on the name of the first *online* site powered by Drupal: Drop.org.

On April 26, 2001, a member of the growing Drupal community gifted Dries the iconic site "Drupal.org" as a place for support, documentation, and application storage for Drupal.

As of August 2011, Drupal.org counts itself with over 630,000 subscribed members.

As an interesting aside on the **state** of Drupal, Dries Buytaert has always maintained ownership of Drupal, even after the software reached over fifteen years of age with such notable sites as the WhiteHouse, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Minnesota, RedHat, the Economist, Bruno Mars, the entire City of Los Angeles, and Weight Watchers.

## In Short

Drupal is, as stated within the last section, a Content Management System.

The question is not what it **is**, the question is what it **can be**!

| Beginner  | Intermediate   | The Future   |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Websites, Web Pages, and Blogging  | Dyanmic Content Generation   | Cross-channel immersive digital experiences   |
| Web Browsers and Forums  | SmartPhones and Multi-Site Content Aggregation   | Any screen, any device, any content, any application   |
| Pre-Defined and Semi-Static Content  | Device and Browser specific Content Generation   | Personal, contextual experiences custom-built for *each* person   |
| Full-Stack Development  | Partially decoupled with extensible Front-Ends  | Delivered with any software package to any device  |

It is a platform for custom-crafting digital experiences.
