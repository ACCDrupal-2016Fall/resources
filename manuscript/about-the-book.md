## Modern Drupal 7 Development

This book is a work-in-progress.

+ If it can be written, it is known.
+ If it is known, it is reproducible.
+ If it can be complicated, someone **will** do so.
+ If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist.

## Goals:

### Instruct users new to Content Management and database systems how to:

1. create modern websites and supporting elements using current authoring tools;
2. maintain websites and supporting elements;
3. and, manage content between local Development and Server environments.
