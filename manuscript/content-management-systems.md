# Content Management Systems

## A Little History

In earliest iterations, HTML was simply a method of *linking* different documents together for collaboration.

To give a point of reference, look to the ```<a>``` tag used in linking between different parts of site-pages and different pages altogether. Instead of being ```<l>``` for *link*, the tag is instead named ```<a>``` for *anchor*. In the early Internet, one of the popular web-browsers was named the [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator "Netscape Navigator").

The name **anchor** follows the *nautical* theme behind "Navigation" and the tag has never truly been updated since, despite being more *accurately* named the "link" tag. Keep this thought in mind, because early web-**sites** were glorified slide-presentations.

## What is a CMS and why should you use one?

### What is content management?

One of the most confusing things for early Drupal Web Authors and Developers is answering the question: "What is content management?"

*Effective* content management means creating a reliable, repeatable method of identifying all content requirements when developing a platform. This platform, in turn, will then (hopefully) create consistently structured content to be reused many, many times. An effective *platform* also has the ability to assemble and produce the content on-demand to meet your needs.

So, a spreadsheet covered in row after row of data **could** be considered a Content Management System, but only if it actually *meets your needs*. A great example of a basic-level CMS is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). One of Drupal's minimally featured competitors, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") takes a script file and some HTML/CSS to transform plain text documents into fully featured static websites and blogs.

We'll get into the difference of *static* and *dynamic* in Web Authoring later, but in this example Drupal is dynamic and Jekyll is static.

### So why a CMS?

So why is the *anchor* tag so important to understanding the importance of Content Management Systems (CMS)?

Because it represents a specific tool created for a specific **task**. Just as the anchor tag was created to interlink specific document sets, plain HTML was created with the self-same purpose. In short, HTML was made to link together documents for reading in sequence. It has since been expanded upon numerous times, which is why HTML5 and CSS3 now exist, but the origins of HTML are far, *far* to limited for accurately **managing Data** and **deliver Content**.

### What is Data and What is Content?

Within a CMS, it is not the **webpages** that are being managed (as within basic HTML), it is the **data**.

Computers were first built to process *data*. Data exists as tiny parts and pieces of other components. A first name, a phone number, a photograph, a sound. Within Drupal (and many other frameworks), *data* is recorded within **fields** on a database table. This is where the need for MySQL, MariaDB, etc. play their part in the development process.

**Content** is data given **context**.

A slight fluttering sound is meaningless in *context*. Yet, if attached there is a description attached which clarifies the sound as the fluttering of a butterflies wings, then the *context* defines the sound for the consumer. Just as a clipping of hair is almost meaningless without the person it goes to.

Because of the need for *context*, at least two pieces of *data* are needed to create a piece of *content*.

As Content and Fields are two vital parts of the Drupal framework, we will be exploring the two items in a little more detail further on in the course.

In the interest of throwing in some random Drupal specific knowledge though, here's a very specific quote that you should understand well by the end of the course:

> A *Page* is a **Bundle** of the *Node* Entity **Type**.

Data can be confusing, yes? This is why we like letting computers handle large portions of it for us.
