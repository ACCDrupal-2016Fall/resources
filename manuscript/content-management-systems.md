## Why A CMS?

In earliest iterations, HTML was simply a method of *linking* different documents together for collaboration.

To give a point of reference, look to the ```<a>``` tag used in linking between different parts of site-pages and different pages altogether. Instead of being ```<l>``` for *link*, the tag is instead named ```<a>``` for *anchor*. In the early Internet, one of the popular web-browsers was named the [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator "Netscape Navigator").

The name **anchor** follows the *nautical* theme behind "Navigation" and the tag has never truly been updated since, despite being more *accurately* named the "link" tag.
