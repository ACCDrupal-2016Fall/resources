## Beyond Drupal.org

Creating an account with *Drupal.org* is merely the first step into a fantastic Community of Developers, Web Authors, Content Editors, Marketers, and many, many more.

Another great resource for getting a leg up in the Drupal Community is joining the [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org "Drupal Association"). Drupal Association members get perks like reduced price training, access to the 'pulse' of Drupal via the Drupal Newsletter, and (sometimes) special offers on early-access to events like DrupalCons or DrupalCamps. The Newsletter is also a great resource for learning about local events in your own community for supporting and developing great products.
