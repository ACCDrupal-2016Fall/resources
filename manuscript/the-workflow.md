From Pantheon.io
Code Moves Up, Content Moves Down

The core of the Pantheon workflow is to move code up from Dev to Test to Live and content down from Live to Test to Dev.

Code includes plugins, modules, themes, CSS, JSâ€”anything that's under Git version control.
Content includes files not under Git version control, like images, PDFs, and the database.
