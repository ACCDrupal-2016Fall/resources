> "If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist."

If there is nothing else this book may teach you, the reader, it is that documentation and a well-implemented version control system (VCS) are the two single-most vital pieces of any digital system. Computer, web, database, mainframe, legacy, it does not matter what the system is, or what the system is used for. As long as a solid VCS is in place (and instructions on how to use it while making it better), the system will continually improve because you, the user, can (and should) take the time to improve it.

Drupal is a fantastic Web 3.0 enabled platform that provide us with a highly RESTful API.

For those unsure of what REST might be, it is actually a fairly *simple* concept that tends to be horribly complicated when trying to read it out of a book. Because of its importance to this class however, I will provide a short definition here.

*Simplified* **REST** - Also known as **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer says that all networks, all databases, everything, should connect through *simple* methods, such as HTTP.

HTTP, as everyone knows, stands for **H**yper-**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol.

This means the **Internet**. The entire World Wide Web (WWW) is a giant network built using REST-based architecture.

We will get into more detail later, but the reason we have come as far as we have today is because **it was documented**, which means **it exists**. With each version, each release, each edit, and each person contributing to the world, the Internet got better and better until a man named Dries Buytaert created a dynamic forum platform that he called Drupal.

Welcome to your journey into Web Authoring with Drupal, a platform and community used by millions of people and tens of thousands of businesses the world over.

## Note

This book is was written with a focused committment on **Novice Level** Drupal. In Car Salesman terms, this woudl be a "Bumper to Bumper" book, but I prefer the Super Hero mentality: "From Zero to Hero".
