# Fito and Charles's Drupal Book Manuscript

## Content assembled for Drupal book

Content we put together for our (as of yet unnamed) Drupal book can go in here.

> One of the things I have learned when it comes to the chapter structure early
> on is to name the directory based on the name of the chapter instead of the
> chapter number. I've reorganized chapter orders a number of times due to
> expanding knowledge and reorganized other times for development based on what
> makes more sense from an organizational standpoint to learn first.
