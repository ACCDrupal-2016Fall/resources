# *Static* vs. *Dynamic*

## Why Should You Use a CMS?

> Build systems, not pages.

> ~~ Brad Frost, Pattern Lab

As stated, within a CMS, it is not the **webpages** that are being managed.

Instead, the system keeps track of a whole bunch of little pieces, which are added together in order to make bigger pieces, which are, in turn, added together to make even bigger pieces.

This is one half of why you hear the phrase about building 'systems' instead of 'pages'. When learning basic HTML and CSS, you worked on manually building *pages* yourself. Within a CMS, you instead build *templates* so that the *pages* are built for you.

Include examples, such as Jekyll sites created via gitpages.io

## Dynamic Websites

## Static vs. Dynamic
Include multiple Use Cases of where Static might be preferred over Dynamic (or Dynamic, such as Drupal, over Static).

Include thoughts on recognizing scenarios where Static sites might actually be *preferable* to Dynamic sites and scenarios where Static sites simply do not meet the Project requirements.

As Web Authors, this may be their responsibility at one point.
