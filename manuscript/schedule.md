# Schedule

Depending on course requirements, available tools, and venue, these times will vary.

The schedule included here is a full guideline based on the original schedule and venue of the course. The venue has all required software installed prior to day one to keep *Dev-Ops* time down and *learning* time up.

Each session is based on a four-hour in-class session, twice a week, for eight weeks. Research, Development, and other challenge tasks will be assigned throughout the course for completion.
