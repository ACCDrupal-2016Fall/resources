# System Requirements

## The System
A local stack capable of running Drupal or WordPress.

Kalabox integrates with the Pantheon platform. Tools such as Acquia Dev Desktop, Drupal VM, Vlad, MAMP, WAMP, XAMPP, and even Docker for Windows all work.

As it is the most **stable** software during the creation of this curriculum, we will be using the [Acquia Dev-Desktop](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop "Acquia Dev-Desktop") for Development within this course.

> Pantheon uses a particular architecture to maximize performance and availability, but it's possible to run the same code on a variety of different configurations. As long as the solution supports a minimum of PHP 5.3 and MySQL, you should be fine.
