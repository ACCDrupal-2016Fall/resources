# System Requirements


### From Pantheon.io
* **1** A local stack capable of running Drupal or WordPress. Kalabox integrates with the Pantheon platform. Tools such as MAMP, WAMP, and XAMPP all work.
> Pantheon uses a particular architecture to maximize performance and availability, but it's possible to run the same code on a variety of different configurations. As long as the solution supports a minimum of PHP 5.3 and MySQL, you should be fine.

* **2** Git client for tracking code changes.\
  We will be using [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win "Git for Windows"), which is available from the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://git-scm.com/sfc "Sofware Freedom Conservancy").
* **3** SFTP client, such as FileZilla, for transferring files OR rsync
* **4** Terminus
* **5** Drush (optional)
