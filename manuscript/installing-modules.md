# Extending Drupal

As we have discussed, one of the greatest strengths of Drupal is just how *modular* and *extensible* it is.

It is so easily extendable that we will be creating both simple modules and simple themes throughout this course.

To **use** these extensions however, they must first be installed. Throughout the course, you will receive the instruction *'Install <this> module'* or *'Install <this> theme'*. It will be assumed that you know the basics of *installing* each extension, whether a module or a theme (though we will not touch on themes until **Unit Three**).

If you need a review at any time, do not hesitate to review the steps below for installing modules.
