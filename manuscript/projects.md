# {{ book.sections.foreword.projects }}

> A **Project**, in relation to Drupal, is a directory containing a tool that can be used to create, extend, or power Drupal. The Core Drupal Distribution, for example, is a Project.

Examples of Projects include:
* **Core Releases:** Drupal 6.x, Drupal 7.x, Drupal 8.x, etc.
* **Distributions:**  Commerce Kickstart, Panopoly, Open Atrium, etc.
* **Themes:** Zen, Bootstrap, Omega, Adaptive Theme, etc.
* **Modules:** Views, Token, Pathauto, etc.
* **Translation projects:** Ukrainian, Hungarian, Spanish, etc.

Distribution projects and Translation Projects are out of scope for this course, but Students are, as always, encouraged to explore the possibilities on their own. The *Web 3.0* world encourages companies and tools to be responsive on a global scale and reaching customers in many different languages can only help a business succeed.

## Projects Used


### Core Release used in this course

This course was written for Drupal 7.43, the final Drupal 7 release.

https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.43-release-notes

### Themes used in this course

* Zen - https://www.drupal.org/project/zen - Since early in both Wordpress and Drupal the Zen theme has remained on the cutting edge of technological *capability*, yet has always kept **extremely** well documented instructions on theming right within the project. In addition, the project maintains standards compliance across the web, so it is always a good choice for aspiring Developers.

### Modules used in this course

* Views
* Ctools
* Libraries
* ThemeKey

> **Note** Some of the required modules are dependent on other modules to install. These dependencies are clarified within each Section where the Module is used, but Students can also see the Project page for any Module to learn about required dependencies.

> **Note** Some Modules also require special *Libraries* to function. These *Libraries*, which typically require the very appropriately named *Libraries* Module, extend Drupal using Projects **external** to Drupal, such as Foundation, Bootstrap, Accessible MegaMenus, the highly accessible Slick Carousel, and more....
