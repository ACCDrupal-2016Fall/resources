# Course Overview

## Rationale

In the past few years, Drupal has grown to become one of the more popular open source Content Management Systems. From large corporations to universities, organizations are choosing Drupal as their web development platform and enterprise solution. It has widespread adoption because it is written in PHP, is extensible, secure, and counts on an ever growing number of developers that continue to work on improving the software. It is currently used by a variety of popular web sites including higher educational institutions such as University of Texas, Kent State, Ohio State, Harvard, Oxford, Duke and Brown, corporations such as weather.com, Twitter, The Economist, The Grammys, LadyGaga.com and even the White House.

## Required Material

* An email account (preferably ending with ```.edu```),
* Access to the Internet,
* A Drupal.org Account (*created within the course*)
* A GitHub (or similar) Account (*created within the course*)
* A Pantheon.io Account (*created within the course*)

> **Note** Other web-based Git repository hosting services (such as GitHub, GitLab, Gogs, etc.) may be used. However, the instruction within the course is only for BitBucket specific configuration and settings. Other services will have their own individualized instruction for creating accounts, hosting code, and uploading/downloading (*this is called 'pushing/pulling'*) from the servers.

> **Note** Pantheon.io was chosen as the most ideal Platform as a Service (PaaS) company for this course, however alternatives exist. See the Appendix for other hosting options such as Digital Ocean (hosting only), GoDaddy (hosting only), Omega8, and Acquia Cloud.

## Challenge Exercises

As mentioned within [Section 0.7: Prerequisites](manuscript/prerequisites.md), many Sections will contain Challenge Exercises to be completed as proof of concept prior to moving on to other Sections within the Course. Your Instructor will most likely review Challenges as they are completed to ensure maximum understanding.

These Challenges are tasks to be completed on **your** Portfolio Site, however. Students are encouraged to go above and beyond the Challenges, which only on *basic* knowledge for each Section covered. Beginner, Intermediate, and Mastery level knowledge can only come through exploring the possibilities within each task assigned.

## Summaries

Each Section and Unit will conclude with a Summary describing the key concepts you, as the Student, should have learned prior to moving forward. Make sure each concept with the **Summary** is thoroughly understood before moving to the next Unit or Section.

Often, Units and Sections will touch on a **very** broad range of subjects, tools, verbiage, and more from the expansive world of Drupal, Web Authoring, and cross-channel digital experiences. However, to keep things simple, only those topics explicitly discussed within the Summary at the end of each Unit/Section are *must have* knowledge to complete the course.

## Further Readings

Each Section and Unit will contain links to external resources such as _[Drupal.org](http://drupal.org "Drupal.org") projects (themes, modules, distros, etc.), Development Tools (Kalabox, Drupal VM, Acquia Dev Desktop, etc.), and other tools.

Some of these resources and tools will be explored throughout the course, but not all. Feel free to explore the world of Drupal. There are over seven thousand modules for Drupal, so make sure you find the best tool for **you**.
